        <p>Welcome to the Keeper of the Realms Support page. Here you'll find answers to frequently asked questions and resources to help you get the most out of KoTR. If you need further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">1. What is Keeper of the Realms?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>I mean, if you've made it this far, you likely already know.  However, just in case..... Keeper of the Realms is a Dungeon Master companion app designed to help create and track campaigns and player characters. It lets you play those campaigns with friends by turning the Dungeon Master responsibilities over to the app. We utilize Gemini, a Large Language Model, to provide the DM for you.  
                    <br>The DM requires highly detailed information about the campaign in order to ensure the campaigns plays out as expected. The DM will fill gaps when needed if the adventure goes an unexpected direction."</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">2. Does this work with all RPG systems or just Dungeons & Dragons?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>While Keeper of the Realms is designed with Dungeons & Dragons in mind, many features can be used for other tabletop RPGs.</p>
                <p>We use Gemini, a Large Language Model, to help with the creation of the campaigns and characters, while also providing the Dungeon Master capabilities. While the LLM knows a lot about a large number of RPGs, it doesn't know everything. So, in some cases, with some RPGs, it'll work better and with others it'll work less effectively.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">3. What features does the app include?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Keeper of the Realms provides three main features:</p>
                <p>Campaign Creation - With AI assistance, easily create engaging campaigns, including encounters, NPCs, locations, loot, and more.</p>
                <p>Character Creation - Create detailed background and descriptions for your characters as you build them with our Character Builder.</p>
                <p>Dungeon Master - Play a campaign with friends and let the app be your Dungeon Master.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">4. Can I import my existing campaign data?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Well..... sort of.....</p>
                <p>You can copy and paste your existing information into the Campaign Builder and let the AI handle the rest. The app can generate Dungeon Master prep notes or create detailed location descriptions based on your existing notes. Just copy the information in and see what the AI can help you create!</p>
            </div>
        </div>


    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">5. Can I create custom monsters, NPCs, or locations?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>Yes! With the Campaign Builder, you have the flexibility to create anything you imagine. Use the AI to structure your campaign or manually add your specific details, encounters, loot, and NPCs.  Or you can take it all on and create the locations yourself.  There's no limit to what you can do.</p>
            </div>
    </div>
  

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">6. Does the app include built-in D&D rules and mechanics?</div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>The Large Language Model knows a lot of the rules for D&D5E along with lots of other versions and RPGs.  However, it doesn't know everything and it won't know anything that came out after it was trained. So, though it's very knowledgable, there may be places where the DM needs some guidance.</p>
        </div>

<div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">7. Can I share my campaign with other players?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Yes! Once you create a custom campaign, you can start a game and let players join you for a fun multiplayer experience.</p>
    </div>
</div>


<div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">8. Can I access my campaigns on multiple devices?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>When you initially begin using the app, you are using it as a GUEST user. This means that your games, campaigns, and characters are not available to your other devices.  However, once you create an account and log in on other devices, youâ€™ll be able to access all your creations and games seamlessly.</p>
    </div>
</div>


<div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">9. Will there be future updates?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>Absolutely! We're actively developing Keeper of the Realms and adding new features based on community feedback. We encourage you to provide feedback within the app and let us know how we can improve.</p>
        <p>In addition to features, we are working on additional campaigns for you to enjoy with friends.</p>

<div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">10. I created a campaign but the Dungeon Master isn't following the story. Why is this?</div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
        <p>The Dungeon Master relies heavily on the 'locations' created within the Campaign Builder. Ensure your campaign includes well-defined locations for the AI to follow the story effectively.</p>
        <p>What does a well-defined location include?  I'm glad you asked.</p>
        <p>In order for the Dungeon Master to run the campaign for you, it needs a list of <b>Locations</b>. The first <b>Location</b> in the list in the Campaign Builder is the starting location.
             For your first campaign, it's best to let the AI build them so you have a feel for what they should contain. Once created, you can go into each location and add additional details.</p>
             <p>In the starting location, after the description of the surrounding area, include an entry like:</p>
             <br>
            DM Notes - The objective of this campaign is to rescue the hostages. Once they are brought back to this location, the campaign objective is complete. When first visiting this location, make sure NPC Elder Rowan approaches the party and asks them if they are here to help rescue the villagers.
        <br>
    <br>
        <p>By adding this detail, you can ensure that the Dungeon Master starts the campaign off correctly and understands the objective of the campaign.  This can be done at various locations to help keep the story going in the right direction.</p>
        <p>Why is this needed? Because the Dungeon Master receives the locations one at a time. This is done to ensure the DM focusses on the right location without getting overwhelmed with all the other details. So, it's important that the location is built in such a way that it provides the required information to keep the story progressing as expected.</p>
